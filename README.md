# ParkingBuddy
Welcome to ParkingBuddy! The website where you can see up-to-date parkingstation-availability and get predictions for future availability.

## How to get started
Open the class 'ParkingBuddyApplication' and run as 'Springboot App'. Then open your browser on 'http://localhost:8080/'. Et-voilà: you can use our website!
In order to get the best predictions, we advise to update the latest data. You can do that by running class 'HistoricalData' once, this will need approximately 20 minutes until finished.
