# ParkingBuddy
Welcome to ParkingBuddy! The website where you can see up-to-date parkingstation-availability and get predictions for future availability.

## How to get started
Open the class 'ParkingBuddyApplication' and run as 'Springboot App' (you'll need to wait less than a minute for it to be ready). Then open your browser on 'http://localhost:8080/'. Et-voilà: you can use our website!
In order to get the best predictions, a function will be automatically executed every day at 10:00 am to update the data files used for the prediction. However, since our website is not online, this will not be done, if the website is not running at that time. Therefore, **'we advise to update the latest data manually'** . You can do this by running the 'HistoricalData' class once, which will need approximately 20 minutes to complete.
